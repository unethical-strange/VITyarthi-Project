# 📄 Project Statement — Contacts Management System

## 📝 Problem Statement
Educational institutions often need a simple, reliable, and efficient method to manage important information such as **Contact Name**, **Contact Number**, and other additional info such as **email id**, **address**, **dob**.  
Traditional manual contact record-keeping can lead to errors, data inconsistency, difficulty in searching, and challenges during updates.

This project addresses these issues by building a **Python-based Command Line Contacts Management System** that allows users to **add, retrieve, update, and delete** contact details quickly and accurately.  
The system ensures smooth navigation through a menu-driven interface and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts widely useful in academic settings.

## 📌 Scope of the Project
### ✔️ The project includes:
- Developing a **modular Python program** that manages Contact records using dictionary-based storage.
- Supporting complete **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Contacts.
- Providing a **user-friendly CLI menu** for smooth interaction.
- Using **in-memory storage**, allowing quick data processing during execution.
- Demonstrating essential programming concepts suitable for **beginners, students, and academic assignments**.

### ❌ The project does *not* include:
- Database connectivity (MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.)
- Permanent data storage in files (can be added as enhancement)
- GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- Multi-user / network-based accessibility

This clearly defines the boundaries and purpose of the system.
